I am a Quantitative Psychologist studying psychological phenomena through a dynamical systems framework. In my work, I examine whether psychological processes are truly continuous in their functioning, and how researchers can define and measure this continuity. I also develop approaches for translating psychological theories into dynamic models such as differential equations, and create accessible tools that helps researchers explore and apply these models.
